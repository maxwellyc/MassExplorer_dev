3D plot & 2D plot using drip line analyzed data
Mass Explorer v3.9 included:
1. separation energy search,
2. separation energy data points are now the first crossing nucleus, lines connected.
3. fixed average problem for drip line analyzed data, some EDF have data for certain nucleus some doesnâ€™t.
4. re-organized webpage contents and added hyperlinks
5. integrated 3D into ME

FIXED:
1.Abnormal points above proton drippily
2.Calculated average proton/neutron drippily
!!!!! THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH PROTON DRIP LINE N=148, ALL 6 EDFS SEEM NOT TO HAVE DRIP LINE DATA AT THAT POINT, INVESTIGATE!!!!

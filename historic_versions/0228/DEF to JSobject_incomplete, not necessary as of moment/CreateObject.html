<!-- For creating JS object, object named after EDF, name:value is e.g 2_2:"$string of data seperated by spacing". This script should then be copied into Sort.html script to work-->

<script>
    //1. loop1: create string by different element one at a time store inside string: obj_value, each string should have 30 columns, for these 6 EDFs' .dat file;
    //2. loop1: extract N,Z save for later to create name for EDF object;
    //3. loop1: create EDF object name as obj_name = "$label string"+"$mass number A string";
    //4. loop1: create object value as obj_value
    //5. end of loop1: iterate and keep adding properties to the EDF object i.e. UNEDF0_obj, use variable stored by steps 2~4.
    //6. eventually will get UNEDF0_obj = {2_2:"2.0000 2.0000 4.0000 ...", 2_4:"2.0000 4.0000 6.0000 ...", ..., ...}, ordering does not matter, access data by i.e UNEDF0_obj["Name_obj"], Name_obj = "2_2";
    //7. Name_obj of step 6: N,Z entered by user, matched by N,Z number, Elem = N + "_" + Z;














    //write raw data from i.e. UNEDF0_JS.dat into one string. These should be left to the end due to huge length.
    var UNEDF0_STR = "A";
    var UNEDF1_STR = "B";
    var SKMS_STR = "C";
    var SKP_STR = "D";
    var SLY4_STR = "E";
    var SV-MIN_STR = "F";
